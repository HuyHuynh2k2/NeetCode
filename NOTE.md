<u>Data Structures - Map:<\u>

1. HashMap: It stores the key-value pair and it can be accessed in O(1) time complexity.
2. TreeMap: It also stores the key-value pair but it keeps them sorted based on keys.
3. LinkedHashMap: It maintains insertion order, which means that when you iterate over a linked hash map, the elements will be returned in the same order as they were inserted into the map.
4. HashTable: It is synchronized version of HashMap class.
